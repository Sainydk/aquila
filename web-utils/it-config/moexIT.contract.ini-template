;
; This file contains data to test function of obtaining contract data from MOEX
; site. Unfortunately this data cannot be obtained automatically because it
; requires a complex web pages processing. Fortunately this data changes
; only 2-3 times a day. To avoid data hardcoding and keep source code unchanged
; the sample contract data was moved to dedicated file. If this file has
; an extension equal to ini-template this is template file. Make a copy of it to
; a new file named moexIT.contract.ini, open it for editing and get back to
; this instruction.
;
; This file should contains a test data of contract details page. Contract
; details page has a typical URL which looks like a:
;
; https://www.moex.com/en/contract.aspx?code=RTS-6.18
;
; where RTS-6.18 is contract code. The values associated with the keys described
; below must reflect exact values of Instrument description section on contract
; page. If there are one or more keys which are not reflected in this file (or
; vice-versa) then this is outdated version. Check you have got a latest version
; from repository, fix this file according to updated ini-template and try
; again. Do not add or remove any lines to pass the test if they aren't in
; ini-template file because it may break the test. Just update the values.
